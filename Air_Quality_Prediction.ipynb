    "##### Air pollution is a critical environmental issue with severe implications for public health and the well-being of our planet. \n",
    "##### In this mini project by Umuthan Ercan for the D7041E Applied Artificial Intelligence course, the focus is on raising awareness about air pollution \n",
    "##### and making predictions for the year 2030 using the World Health Organization (WHO) dataset. \n",
    "##### By employing data preprocessing techniques and a Random Forest Regressor model, the script aims to analyze historical \n",
    "##### air pollution data, identify risky countries projected to surpass a defined threshold in 2030, and contribute to the understanding \n",
    "##### of potential future challenges. This initiative underscores the significance of proactive measures and awareness in mitigating \n",
